Our security measures include encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls to personal data, regular security testing, and staff training. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where legally required.</p>

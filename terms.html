                    <p>Vinebud is committed to sustainable gardening practices. We strive to use organic methods whenever possible, minimize water usage, and reduce waste. However, certain situations may require the use of chemical treatments for pest control or plant health. We will notify you and obtain your consent before using any chemical treatments. You may request details about the products we use at any time. We are not responsible for any environmental conditions or changes that occur after our Services are performed, including but not limited to plant growth, weather effects, or pest activity.</p>
